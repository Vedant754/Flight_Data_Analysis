## 🎯 Project Summary

This project analyzes a large flight dataset to understand:

* Which **airlines and cities** dominate air traffic.
* How **departure and arrival times** affect flight schedules.
* What factors influence **ticket pricing trends** over time.

The findings are supported with clean, data-driven visualizations built in **Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)**.

## 📊 Key Insights

✨ **Vistara** operates the **most flights**, while **SpiceJet** has the fewest.

🕓 **Morning** departures and **Evening/Night** arrivals are most common.

📈 Ticket prices **spike as the departure date approaches** (especially <10 days).

🏙️ **Delhi** and **Mumbai** lead as the top source cities for air travel.
